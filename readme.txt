In regards to extra credit, I didn't do the recommended bonus features, but I learned how to use tooltip in Vega-lite to have the graphs interactive when hovering over it which can possibly count as an extra feature for extra credit.

2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

It took about 24 hours for me to do which spanned over 3-4 days to do.

5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code? For part 2 the second graph, the button Show means starts at the bottom for some reason, but goes back to normal after pressing it. Aside from that just run live-server!
